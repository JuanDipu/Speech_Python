So we were checking asset last class. What was an asset? Do you remember what was an asset? Asset. We said asset minus liabilities equals stockholders equity. Remember that one? Yes, but on the malcolm, do not worry. So my last question regarding the asset was, how can we talk about assets in HR? And your answer was people capabilities. That was your answer, like talent. Right. So what was the assets? Let me do the equation. Maybe that helps you. Minus liability. It's what? Great, perfect. Okay, awesome. So you said people capabilities, talent. What else could be an asset not only for HR, but for a company, for a non knowledge? Okay, what if we take out HR? Like, not HR, but we say in a company. What else could be an asset in a company? Let's say in Lucico, for example, some containers. Containers, all right. I always put to us. Okay, we got some containers. All right, what else could be an asset? Officers offices. Offices? Yes, offices. Okay, what else? I don't know. Yeah, containers, offices. Some of the cars are from the company. Right.

All right, perfect. Yeah. So they have the cards from the company. All right. So we're talking about assets. And the last question we did regarding assets, I think we couldn't do it. Yeah, it was the discussion of the startup, right. Specializing in AI. All right, very good. So we're going to go with the next one. The next one is called attrition. What's? Attrition. Do we know that? Yes, attrition. So let's check the definition. Could you read it a term used to describe used to? Yeah, it's not the expression, but it's used to. All right. Used to describe voluntary involuntary terminations. This an employee an employee retirement that result in a reduction to the employer's physical workforce. Yeah, but not by layups, something you cannot control as a company. Okay. Is it clear the definition? So let's check out example says the high attrition rates are something that we need to resolve urgently. So what is attrition? Attrition is one, we have some terminations that we were not contemplating employee retirements or debts. Do we know what I said? Yes. Do we understand debt? Debts? Yeah. Oh, I cannot hear you well. Sorry, I don't know why. I don't know why. I started hearing you from, like, a different microphone and now I don't hear you well. Can you speak similar layoffs? No. Death is when you're dead. That's a debt attrition. So attrition is not a layoff. Okay? Because a layoff is something the company wants, but attrition is something the company doesn't want. It's like you have a reduction of the physical workforce, but it's a reduction of the physical workforce, but the company was not expecting that. All right, attrition. Do we have a word like that in Spanish in HR, when the workforce is reduced, but the company was not expecting the reduction of the workforce. No. Yeah. I don't know. I have never heard this word in Spanish. Okay. But I've heard it here when people started quitting a lot. Yeah. Okay, so let's check out examples. So here we're going to do okay, awesome. So cute. We read this part. Let's read this part. The organization has been facing high attrition rates, particularly within the customer service department. The HR team needs to investigate and implement measures to improve employee retention. Okay. Is it clear what's happening? Yes. Okay, so both you and I, we're going to work in HR, and we're going to discuss what can we do for this attrition all? Right. Okay, you ready? So let's do it. Okay, so let's say the meeting just started. Okay? Awesome. Okay. Good morning, Alejandro. Good morning. So, as you know, we're having facing attrition rates that are not the ones we want for the company. Have you heard about this problematic in the company? Yes. We have a great program for improve for improving of our employees. For example, we can review their salaries and benefits or page of compensation. Just compensation. Just compensation. Compensation. And we could review their performance. Good. And with this information, we decide how we could help for your needs. All right. So we are both working in HR, right? We're just like partners. We're coworkers. Okay. Okay. Yes. And I know the talent retention program is really good, but we're having a problem because we have customer service attrition and do you know why? It could be happening in customer service? Are the customers too rude? Where are people quitting customer service? Yeah. Why? Because this problem is happening in customer service. That's why. It's. The west is Western customer service. Why is in customer service and not in any other area? This area is very difficult because the people need more tolerance, good tolerance and training in how in how to make different feelings. Different feelings? Is that different? Yes. For example, happiness. But you said how to make different feelings, how to make now how to the people need now? Yes, to now different ways to know different ways for different ways for improving good. Their customer service. And how do you say manihar manage and how manage how to manage how to manage difficult clients. Yes, how to manage difficult clients. Okay, perfect. So could you talk to me a little bit about because I'm new in the company. Could you talk to me a little bit about the talent retention program that we have right now? So maybe we can add some specific things for this customer service strategy. Yes, we could make bonus for improving their results. Okay, good. So we're going to call them like goal based bonuses. Do you like the name? Goal based bonuses? Yes. Okay, perfect. Awesome. So bonuses for improving results. Okay. What can we do regarding the fact that they need a lot of patience and the customers are really being hard? Is there anything we can do from HR for that? So they can manage the frustration, they can manage the anger, they can manage their emotions? Yes. We should change the people for AI HR manager. Goodbye. Yeah, AI will never get tired, right? Very difficult. Yes, these skills are very difficult. All right, but what if we implement I don't know. What if we adapt the wellness program for people that have had a terrible day and we get, like, masseuse and massages in the company? I don't know. Masseuse? Masseuse, massages. Do you know what are these massages? Masseuse is the profession of somebody that gives massages. Okay. Right. So what do you think about this idea? Is it too expensive? Do you think the board will approve this? Yeah. Yes. They need the same skill, and I need the in this company. Okay, perfect. Is there anything else that we could implement to reduce Attrition? Implement? Yeah. Is there any other policy we can implement as HR to reduce Attrition? We could review the job descriptions oh. And evaluate each profile. Because sometimes we have people in jobs how do you say equocals? Wrong in wrong job. Wrong jobs. Okay. That is very interesting. Okay, great. Anything else that you would add to this meeting? Or should we just send these three points to the board? It now I don't like speaking to the board. Can you speak to the board? Can you present this to the board? I get really nervous. I don't like it. I don't know. Could you do it for me? Could you present us to the board? What is the board? Do you understand when I say the board? Yes. Okay, perfect.

What is the on with that? He must resolve all situations in different areas. Oh, okay. He's right. He's always right. Yeah. He says I'm always right. Remember this? Yes. He says I'm always right. Okay, perfect. So he has to solve situations many areas. Okay. Let's check out this example. Could you read this example. His leadership style is on the authoritarian side. Do we know what it's tight site? Yes. No site is lado tapori lado authoritarian. Right. So his leadership style is on the authoritarian side. Oh, yeah.

I'm going to say this from the project manager. All right. And I most different. Depends. You can defend him or you can say, oh, yeah, this is very wrong. I will talk to him. All right. You choose.
